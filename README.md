Budget Analysis, Sum of Numbers, and Ocean Levels
Overview:
This repository contains Python scripts for performing various financial and mathematical calculations. Below is a brief description of each program:

Budget Analysis:
This program allows users to input their budget for a month and track their expenses. It calculates whether the total expenses exceed, meet, or fall below the budget.

Sum of Numbers:
This script calculates the sum of positive numbers entered by the user. It terminates when the user enters a negative number.

Ocean Levels:
This program predicts the rise in ocean levels over the next 25 years based on a given annual rise rate.

How to Use:
Budget Analysis:

Run the script.
Enter your budget for the month.
Input your expenses one by one.
When prompted, enter 'y' to add another expense or any other key to finish.
The program will then display whether you are over, under, or on budget, along with the total expenses.
Sum of Numbers:

Execute the script.
Enter positive numbers one by one.
To end, input a negative number.
The program will output the sum of all positive numbers entered.
Ocean Levels:

Run the script.
The program will display the projected rise in ocean levels for the next 25 years.
